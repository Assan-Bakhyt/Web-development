        <p><b>After weeks of practice,</b> I finally feel confident saying that I’ve learned Python. It didn’t happen in one big jump-more like many small steps: understanding the basics, making lots of mistakes, and fixing them one by one.<br>
        At first, I struggled with simple things like loops, functions, and reading error messages. But once I started building small projects (even very simple ones), everything began to make sense. Writing code every day helped me the most, because Python became familiar instead of scary.<br>
        Now I can write clean scripts, work with lists and dictionaries, create functions, and solve beginner problems without panic. I’m proud of this progress, and I know this is only the beginning-I want to keep improving and build bigger projects next.</p>

        <p><b>Python is often called one of the best programming languages</b> because it’s simple to read, quick to write, and useful in many different areas. Its clean syntax helps beginners learn programming faster, while still being powerful enough for real-world projects.<br>
Python is also extremely versatile: people use it for web development, data analysis, automation, machine learning, and scripting. On top of that, it has a huge community and thousands of libraries, so you can usually find a tool or example to solve a problem without starting from zero.</p>
